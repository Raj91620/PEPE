# Recent Changes (November 7, 2025)

## Final Channel Verification Cleanup (November 7, 2025 - Latest)
- **Completed Removal of All Channel Verification Logic**:
  - Removed misleading error messages from `server/routes.ts` that referenced channel/bot verification
  - Added deprecation comments to `verifyChannelMembership` function in `server/telegram.ts` to indicate it's no longer used
  - Removed backup file `client/src/components/TaskSection.tsx.txt` to avoid confusion
  - Task completion now truly requires zero verification - instant rewards for all task types
  - Error messages now accurately reflect the verification-free flow
- **Backend Behavior**:
  - All channel and bot tasks are auto-verified (isVerified = true by default)
  - Share link, invite friend, and ads goal tasks still check actual completion status
  - No Telegram API calls made for channel membership verification
  - Simple flow: User clicks Check → Instant reward (no external verification)

## GitHub Import Setup & Reward System Fixes (November 7, 2025)
- **Replit Environment Setup Completed**:
  - Installed all Node.js dependencies via npm
  - Configured development workflow on port 5000 with webview
  - Server running successfully with all database migrations applied
  - Vite dev server configured with proper host settings (0.0.0.0, allowedHosts: true)
- **Completely Removed Channel Join Verification**:
  - Deleted `/api/streak/check-membership` endpoint from `server/routes.ts`
  - Removed all channel verification logic from `/api/streak/claim` endpoint
  - Users now receive rewards directly without needing to join Telegram channels

  - Daily task rewards now fetched from `reward_per_ad` admin setting instead of hardcoded 0.00033000 TON
  - When admin updates `reward_per_ad` in admin panel, all new daily tasks use that value
  - Conversion: reward_per_ad (MGB) / 5,000,000 = reward in TON
- **Verified Default Fallback Values**:
  - `reward_per_ad` default: 1000 MGB (used only if admin setting not configured)
  - `task_per_click_reward` default: 0.0001750 TON = 875 MGB (for advertiser tasks)
  - `task_reward_pad` default: 200 (display padding, not actual reward amount)
- **Deployment Configuration**:
  - Configured deployment target as `vm` for stateful bot application
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Start command: `npm start`

- **Removed unused API call**: Eliminated /api/user/stats endpoint call from Home.tsx

## Admin Dashboard Visibility Fix
- **Removed all hardcoded admin IDs** from the entire codebase
- Fixed admin dashboard visibility to use environment variables exclusively:
  - `server/routes.ts`: Promo code creation now checks `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_ID` or `ADMIN_ID` environment variable
  - `server/storage.ts`: Admin user setup now uses environment variable with graceful fallback
  - `storage.ts`: Admin user setup now uses environment variable with graceful fallback
- Admin access now dynamically determined by `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_ID` or `ADMIN_ID` environment variable
- **No code redeployment needed** when changing admin ID - just update the environment variable
- Frontend admin check uses `VITE_ADMIN_ID` environment variable (must match backend)

## Telegram Bot Admin Panel Updates

- This means 500,000 MGB = 0.1 TON
- Admin settings now display minimum withdrawal in MGB instead of TON for clarity
- Backend continues to store values in TON for precision, with automatic conversion to/from MGB in the UI

# System Architecture

## Frontend
*   **Frameworks**: React with TypeScript, Vite.
*   **Routing**: Wouter.
*   **State Management**: TanStack Query.
*   **UI/UX**: shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, custom CSS for theming (light/dark mode), Framer Motion for animations. Features a diamond-themed UI with a cyan and silver palette, frosted glass cards, glow effects, and sparkle animations.
*   **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
*   **Navigation**: Curved bottom navigation and a top-left hamburger menu with Lucide React icons.
*   **Anti-Cheat**: Implemented a 3-second minimum ad watch time to prevent fast claiming.
*   **Wallet Activity**: Dedicated page for displaying transaction history with status indicators.
*   **Leaderboard**: Monthly leaderboards for PAD earners and referrers, with user rank display.

## Backend
*   **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
*   **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL.
*   **API**: RESTful API with JSON responses.
*   **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store.
*   **Telegram Bot**: Integration for admin controls, broadcasts, and user notifications.
*   **Security**: Parameterized queries, device tracking for multi-account prevention.

## Authentication & Authorization
*   **Provider**: Replit OAuth (OpenID Connect).
*   **Session Strategy**: Server-side sessions with secure HTTP-only cookies.
*   **Authorization**: Middleware-based route protection.
*   **User Management**: Automatic user creation/updates, device ID-based multi-account prevention.

## Data Storage
*   **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL.
*   **Schema Management**: Drizzle migrations.
*   **Key Entities**: Users (balance, streaks, referrals), Earnings, Withdrawals, Referral relationships, Sessions, Advertiser Tasks, Task Clicks.

## Business Logic
*   **Ad Watching System**: Users earn PAD per ad with cooldowns and minimum watch time. Rewards dynamically pulled from admin settings; notifications display actual MGB amount earned. Backend increments adsWatched and adsWatchedToday counters, synchronized with frontend stats.
*   **Gamification**: Spin & Win system and Daily Streak rewards.
*   **Referral Program**: Multi-level commission on referred users' ad earnings.
*   **Withdrawal System**: MGB-based withdrawals (1 TON = 5,000,000 MGB internally, or 500,000 MGB = 0.1 TON), minimum friend invite requirement, admin approval, TON wallet address validation (UQ/EQ prefix, 48 characters).
*   **Currency System**: Earnings and tasks displayed as PAD (1 TON = 100,000 PAD internally). Withdrawals are exclusively in MGB. Internal database storage uses TON for precision.
*   **Admin Controls**: Comprehensive settings for affiliate commission, wallet change fees, minimum withdrawal, task rewards, task creation cost, balance conversion, and broadcast functionality.
*   **Task System**: Users can create tasks (e.g., join Telegram channels) with strict Telegram link validation (only https://t.me/ or t.me/ links allowed). Invalid links are rejected before TON/PDZ deduction to prevent user balance loss.
