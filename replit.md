# System Architecture

## Frontend
*   **Frameworks**: React with TypeScript, Vite.
*   **Routing**: Wouter.
*   **State Management**: TanStack Query.
*   **UI/UX**: shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, custom CSS for theming (light/dark mode), Framer Motion for animations. Features a diamond-themed UI with a cyan and silver palette, frosted glass cards, glow effects, and sparkle animations.
*   **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
*   **Navigation**: Curved bottom navigation and a top-left hamburger menu with Lucide React icons.
*   **Anti-Cheat**: Implemented a 3-second minimum ad watch time to prevent fast claiming.
*   **Wallet Activity**: Dedicated page for displaying transaction history with status indicators.
*   **Leaderboard**: Monthly leaderboards for PAD earners and referrers, with user rank display.

## Backend
*   **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
*   **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL.
*   **API**: RESTful API with JSON responses.
*   **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store.
*   **Telegram Bot**: Integration for admin controls, broadcasts, and user notifications.
*   **Security**: Parameterized queries, device tracking for multi-account prevention.

## Authentication & Authorization
*   **Provider**: Replit OAuth (OpenID Connect).
*   **Session Strategy**: Server-side sessions with secure HTTP-only cookies.
*   **Authorization**: Middleware-based route protection.
*   **User Management**: Automatic user creation/updates, device ID-based multi-account prevention.

## Data Storage
*   **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL.
*   **Schema Management**: Drizzle migrations.
*   **Key Entities**: Users (balance, streaks, referrals), Earnings, Withdrawals, Referral relationships, Sessions, Advertiser Tasks, Task Clicks.

## Business Logic
*   **Ad Watching System**: Users earn PAD per ad with cooldowns and minimum watch time. Rewards dynamically pulled from admin settings; notifications display actual MGB amount earned. Backend increments adsWatched and adsWatchedToday counters, synchronized with frontend stats.
*   **Gamification**: Spin & Win system and Daily Streak rewards.
*   **Referral Program**: Multi-level commission on referred users' ad earnings.
*   **Withdrawal System**: MGB-based withdrawals (1 TON = 10,000,000 MGB internally), minimum friend invite requirement, admin approval, TON wallet address validation (UQ/EQ prefix, 48 characters).
*   **Currency System**: Earnings and tasks displayed as PAD (1 TON = 100,000 PAD internally). Withdrawals are exclusively in MGB. Internal database storage uses TON for precision.
*   **Admin Controls**: Comprehensive settings for affiliate commission, wallet change fees, minimum withdrawal, task rewards, task creation cost, balance conversion, and broadcast functionality.
*   **Task System**: Users can create tasks (e.g., join Telegram channels) with strict Telegram link validation (only https://t.me/ or t.me/ links allowed). Invalid links are rejected before TON/PDZ deduction to prevent user balance loss.
